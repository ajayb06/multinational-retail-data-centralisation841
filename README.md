# Multinational-Retail-Data-Dentralisation

#### Project Summary

As a global enterprise offering a diverse range of products worldwide, we're facing a challenge with scattered sales information from various channels, complicating our analysis efforts. The primary objective of our project is to unify this information into a centralized, easily analyzable repository. The initial phase involves constructing a system that merges all of our existing data into a single, cohesive database. Subsequent phases will focus on utilizing this unified database to extract up-to-date business metrics, thereby enhancing our company's capacity for data-informed decision-making.

These are the following sources where data was extracted from:
- Data stored in AWS RDS
- PDF stored in a AWS S3 Bucket
- JSON data from REST API
- A CSV file in a AWS S3 Bucket
- JSON file stored in a AWS S3 Bucket
